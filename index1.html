				<p>The fishing area is a waters area which the fishing gear can be operated perfectly well to exploit fish resources that in it. A few criteria that could be the fishing area are:
					<br/>
						1. The waters area that suitable for fish, and other things could affect with physical oceanographic parameters, biology and chemicals.
						<br/>
						2. The fishing gear that is easy to operate.
						<br/>
						3. The fishing area has a lot of fish resources and it has high economic value.
						<br/>
						<br/>
				The geographic and ecological features can be affected to that characterize the different fishing regions. The examples of geographic features are ground contour, rapids and water flow. The ecological features includes physical-chemical states, and biological states. Physical-chemical states all about temperature, water turbidity, and salinity of water. Also the biological features all about foods for fish, the competitors, predators that haunt fish, and disease.

				<p>Some fish in the world are top predators, while the rest of the fish are primary consumers for them. The top preators like Salmon, Pollock and Cod live in cold ocean waters; others like Tuna and Mackerel are adapt to warmer waters.Then groundfish includes Cod, Sole, Rockfish, Haddock, and Flounder spends part or all of their life on or near the bottom. Others, like Herring and Anchovies, live near the surface. There is many factors that contributed to "Global Fisheres Crisis". 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The global fisheries crisis can causing many global fisheries are threatened by multiple human impacts, including fishing methods and technology, coastal human populations, and demand for seafood. Scientists estimate that humans have removed as much as 90 percent of the ocean's large predatory fish, including sharks, swordfish, and cod. In some countries, up to 70 percent of the protein consumed comes from seafood.

				<p>For the example, we use Salmon fish. Salmon /ˈsæmən/ is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and Pacific Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus). 
<br/>
<br/>
Most of Salmon fish live in the Atlantic Ocean. Atlantic Ocean has a litte pollution in there, the toxicity level is lower that other oceans. Because of it, the Salmon fish are not susceptible to sick. Salmon fish contains omega-3 and other vitamins that is good for our healthy. Salmon usually eats shrimp, crabs, and little fish. In US, Salmon fish are caught around 10 tons per year, this amount is a little bit higher than Indonesia around 6.8 tons per year and other countries. But in 6 November 2018, salmon fish were crossing a road in Washington DC. because of the flood that hit the town. It happens because of global warming.
