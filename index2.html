				<p>Fish migration is a movement from one place to another which means adjustment to natural conditions that are beneficial for the existence of life. Fish carry out migration with the aim of spawning, looking for food and areas suitable for their survival.

				Observe the fish,is very difficult to do. We just need to track fish, but before that, we just mark and recapture, collection, and data collection fish. There is two common methods used to monitor fish population movement mapping, or tracking, and mark and recapture. Tracking is a process in which marine biologists and resource managers use technology to tag fish and map their movements. Mark and recapture is a process where a small group of a particular fish species is captured, marked or tagged, and then released so that they can be recognized during a later recapture. These methods help scientists better understand numbers and distributions of fish populations.</p>

				<p>	Fish tags are important tools for assessing fish populations. Conducted properly, tagging can provide information on movement patterns, seasonal variations, harvest levels, and birth and mortality rates—all of which can lead to healthier fish stocks. Divide students into teams of three. After a population of fish has been captured, marked, and released, scientists then go back and recapture another sample of fish from the same area; some of which may be marked and some of which may not be marked.
				<br/>
				<br/>
			A simple ratio is then calculated to represent the total population of the species. The population size can be estimated from as few as two visits to the study area, but more than two visits are desired for increased accuracy. If needed, demonstrate the mark and recapture process, including the completion of a data table section, before students conduct the experiment on their own. </p>
